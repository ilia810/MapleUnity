# Unity Physics 60 FPS Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the Unity integration to use FixedUpdate for physics at 60 FPS while maintaining smooth rendering at any framerate through visual interpolation.

## Changes Made

### 1. GameManager.cs Updates
- Moved PhysicsConfiguration initialization to `Awake()` to ensure physics settings are applied as early as possible
- Separated input handling and physics updates:
  - `Update()`: Handles input processing via `gameWorld.ProcessInput()` and visual interpolation
  - `FixedUpdate()`: Handles physics updates via `gameWorld.UpdatePhysics(Time.fixedDeltaTime)`
- Added `UpdateVisualInterpolation()` method to apply smooth rendering between physics frames
- Removed redundant `LateUpdate()` method

### 2. Visual Interpolation System
- Added interpolation support to `MonsterView` and `PlayerView` classes
- Each view tracks previous and current positions updated in `FixedUpdate()`
- Visual positions are interpolated in `Update()` using the physics system's interpolation factor
- Added `SetInterpolationFactor()` method to allow manual control of interpolation

### 3. Existing Physics Infrastructure
The following components were already in place and are now properly integrated:

#### PhysicsConfiguration.cs
- Sets `Time.fixedDeltaTime` to 0.01667 (60 FPS)
- Configures Unity's physics settings
- Disables Unity's built-in physics simulation

#### PhysicsDebugger.cs
- Provides debug UI overlay showing:
  - Current FPS and frame timing
  - Physics steps per second
  - Interpolation factor
  - Performance warnings if physics deviates from 60 FPS
- Toggle with F3 key

#### PhysicsUpdateManager.cs
- Manages fixed timestep physics updates
- Uses accumulator pattern for deterministic 60 FPS physics
- Provides interpolation factor for smooth rendering
- Tracks physics objects and performance metrics

## How It Works

1. **Physics Updates (FixedUpdate - 60 FPS)**
   - GameWorld.UpdatePhysics() is called at fixed 60 FPS
   - PhysicsUpdateManager processes all physics objects
   - Positions are updated deterministically

2. **Input Processing (Update - Variable FPS)**
   - GameWorld.ProcessInput() handles user input
   - No physics calculations, just input state management

3. **Visual Interpolation (Update - Variable FPS)**
   - Interpolation factor calculated from physics accumulator
   - Visual positions smoothly interpolated between physics frames
   - Ensures smooth movement even at high framerates (120+ FPS)

## Testing
- Press F3 to toggle the physics debug overlay
- Monitor that "Physics steps per second" stays at 60
- Verify smooth visual movement at different framerates
- Check that physics remain deterministic and frame-perfect

## Benefits
- Physics run at exactly 60 FPS matching MapleStory v83
- Rendering remains smooth at any framerate
- Deterministic physics for consistent gameplay
- Clear separation between physics and rendering
