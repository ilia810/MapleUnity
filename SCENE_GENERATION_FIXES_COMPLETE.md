# Scene Generation Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Tile Extraction Fixed
**Problem**: Tiles existed in map data (859 tiles) but weren't being extracted because they lacked the "tS" property.

**Solution**: 
- Added `GetDefaultTileSet()` method that infers "wood" for Henesys area
- Modified `ExtractTilesFromNode()` to use default tile set when "tS" is missing
- Successfully extracts all 859 tiles now

**Files Modified**:
- `MapDataExtractor.cs`: Added default tile set logic
- `TestTileExtraction.cs`: Created test to verify extraction

### 2. ✅ Background Type 3 Handling
**Problem**: Blue 256x256 squares (grassySoil) weren't being tiled properly as sky backgrounds.

**Solution**:
- Added handling for background type 3 (full-screen tiling)
- Created `CreateFullScreenTiledBackground()` method
- Sky backgrounds now tile properly across the screen

**Files Modified**:
- `BackgroundGenerator.cs`: Added type 3 handling

### 3. ✅ NPC Sorting Order Fixed (Previous Session)
**Problem**: NPCs appeared behind buildings.

**Solution**:
- Fixed sorting order to use negative Y position
- NPCs now render in front of buildings correctly

### 4. ⚠️ Tile Sprite Loading Issue (Current)
**Problem**: Tile sprites fail to load - path structure might be incorrect.

**Partial Solution**:
- Created dedicated `GetTileSprite()` method in `NXDataManagerSingleton.cs`
- Updated `TileGenerator.cs` to use new method
- Created `DebugTileStructure.cs` to investigate tile structure

**Next Steps**:
1. Run "MapleUnity > Debug > Tile Structure" to understand the actual tile data structure
2. Update paths based on findings
3. Verify sprites load correctly

## Background Types Reference
- Type 0: Static single image
- Type 1: Tiled horizontally  
- Type 3: Tiled both directions (sky/color fill)
- Type 4: Scrolling effect

## Testing Instructions

### Test Tile Extraction:
1. MapleUnity > Test > Tile Extraction Fix
2. Click "Test Henesys Tile Extraction"
3. Should show 859 tiles extracted with "wood" tile set

### Debug Tile Structure:
1. MapleUnity > Debug > Tile Structure
2. Click "Debug Wood Tile Structure" to see how tiles are organized
3. Click "List All Tile Sets" to see available tile sets

### Generate Scene:
1. MapleUnity > Test Scene Generation
2. Click "Generate Henesys Scene"
3. Check Hierarchy for:
   - Backgrounds with proper tiling
   - Tiles (may show as gray placeholders if sprites not loading)
   - Objects with correct sprites
   - NPCs in front of buildings

## Known Issues
- Tile sprites not loading yet (need to verify correct path structure)
- Sprites may appear black/transparent (PNG extraction issue from previous work)
