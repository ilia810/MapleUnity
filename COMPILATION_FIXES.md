# Compilation Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. PlayerSpawnManager.cs
- Changed `mapData.VRBounds` to use `mapData.Width` and `mapData.Height` (VRBounds doesn't exist in GameLogic.MapData)
- Removed direct assignment to `player.State` (it has a private setter)

### 2. FootholdPhysicsConnector.cs
- Added missing namespace imports: `MapleClient.SceneGeneration` for Foothold class
- Modified Initialize method to work with FootholdManager's actual interface
- Removed unused DeterminePlatformType method

### 3. FootholdManager.cs
- Added `GetAllFootholds()` method to expose the footholds list

### 4. BackgroundGenerator.cs
- Changed from singleton pattern to instance-based BackgroundTilePool
- Each ViewportBackgroundLayer now creates its own tile pool
- Updated tile pool usage to match the BackgroundTilePool interface

## Key Changes:

### MapData Structure
The GameLogic.MapData class has these properties:
- `Width` and `Height` (pixels) - not VRBounds
- `Platforms` - list of Platform objects
- `Portals` - list of Portal objects
- No direct Footholds property

### Player State Management
- Player.State has a private setter
- State changes happen internally in the Player class
- Don't set State directly from outside

### Foothold/Platform Bridge
- FootholdPhysicsConnector converts Unity Footholds to GameLogic Platforms
- This maintains separation between Unity-specific and game logic code

## Next Steps:
1. Ensure all files compile without errors
2. Test player spawning in generated maps
3. Verify movement and physics work correctly
4. Check that flickering is resolved
