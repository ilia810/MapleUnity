Understood. I’ll investigate why the `GetPlatformBelow()` method in `Player.cs` fails to detect any platforms, causing the player to fall continuously. This will include tracing the collision detection logic, coordinate conversions, platform bounds evaluation, and the LINQ filtering logic.

I’ll review the code in `Player.cs` (lines 215–237) and related components to identify the root cause and provide a detailed analysis with recommendations for fixing this critical issue.


**Collision Detection Flow:** The `Player.UpdatePhysics` method applies gravity and updates the player’s position each frame, then checks for a platform underneath when the player is falling (Velocity.Y ≤ 0). It calls `GetPlatformBelow(newPosition, mapData)`, which attempts to find the highest platform segment directly below the player’s feet. If a platform is found and the player’s downward movement would cross onto it, the code snaps the player to the platform’s surface and sets `IsGrounded = true` (stopping the fall). This is how landing is supposed to work.

**GetPlatformBelow Logic:** This function converts the player’s coordinates to the map’s pixel coordinate system and filters the platform list for viable candidates:

* **Coordinate Conversion:** The player’s position is in Unity “units” (where 1 unit = 100 pixels). The code multiplies `position.X` by 100 to get `posX` (player’s X in pixels) and `position.Y - (PLAYER_HEIGHT/2)` by 100 to get `posY` for the player’s **bottom** Y-coordinate in pixels. (PLAYER\_HEIGHT is 0.6 units, i.e. 60px.)

* **Horizontal Bounds Filter:** It then filters `mapData.Platforms` for segments where `posX` lies between the platform’s endpoints `X1` and `X2`. In our case, Platform 1 spans X=-1500 to X=1500 (px), so with `posX ≈ -440px` the player is above that platform horizontally. Platform 2 spans X=-300 to X=300, so `-440px` would exclude that one.

* **Platform Y Calculation:** For each candidate, it computes the platform’s Y at that X via `Platform.GetYAtX(posX)`. This handles sloped platforms; for flat platforms it just returns the constant Y. Platform 1 is flat at Y=0 (px), so `GetYAtX(-440)` returns 0. (Platform 2 is at Y=150, but it wasn’t in range.)

* **Vertical Proximity Filter:** It then ignores any platform much lower than the player by requiring `platform.Y <= posY + 50`. This “50 pixels” buffer means the platform’s Y must be **no more than 50px below** the player’s bottom. Essentially, the code looks for the nearest platform underneath. Finally, it sorts candidates by Y descending and picks the highest one.

**Why No Platform Was Detected:** Given the above, we can see why `GetPlatformBelow` returned null in the scenario:

* **Spawn Position Below Ground:** The player spawned at Unity coordinates (-4.4, -0.8) as per the debug logs (X \~ -440px, Y \~ -80px in MapleStory terms). Platform 1’s Y = 0px is actually **above** the player’s starting position. This happened because the spawn portal’s Y was negative in the map data, and the conversion in `GameManager` didn’t account for MapleStory’s coordinate system. The spawn code simply did `Player.Position = (portal.X/100, portal.Y/100 + 1)`. If `portal.Y` was -180px (meaning 180px *above* ground in Maple coordinates), dividing by 100 gave -1.8 (units) and then +1 = -0.8 units. Instead of spawning above the ground, the player was placed 0.8 units below Y=0. In MapleStory’s map data, Y=0 typically corresponds to the bottom of the map (ground level), and **negative** Y values indicate positions *above* ground (because Maple’s origin is likely the bottom-left of the map with Y increasing downward). Since the code didn’t invert the Y-axis, a negative portal Y translated into a negative Unity Y position – sinking the player underground.

* **Platform Filter Fails:** Once the player is below the platform, the filter condition `p.Y <= posY + 50` will exclude that platform. Plugging in the values: the player’s bottom `posY = (-0.8 − 0.3)*100 = -110`px. So `posY + 50 = -60`px. Platform 1’s Y at that X is 0px. The check `0 <= -60` is false, so Platform 1 is filtered out. In other words, `GetPlatformBelow` only searches for platforms **underneath** the player’s feet (within 50px). It doesn’t consider a platform that is above or level with the player’s current position. Thus, with the player starting below ground, the ground platform wasn’t recognized as a landing surface.

* **No Platform Found:** Since no other platform fell within the criteria, `candidatePlatforms` came up empty and the function returned `null`. The `UpdatePhysics` loop therefore did not enter the landing logic at all. The player remained in free-fall, and `IsGrounded` was never set to true. Gravity kept increasing downward velocity each frame, so the character just continued to fall infinitely.

**IsGrounded Stays False:** The `IsGrounded` flag is only set true when the landing condition is met. In our case it never flipped, because the character never “landed” in the eyes of the code. Even if the player visually intersects a platform, the logic won’t snap or stop unless the above conditions are satisfied. So with the current implementation, a player who starts below a platform or falls through due to a logic oversight will never recover – `IsGrounded` remains false and gravity keeps acting.

**Coordinate Conversion Issue:** The root cause appears to be a mismatch in coordinate systems. All map collision data (platform X1, Y1, etc.) is stored in MapleStory’s coordinate space. The code correctly scales these by 100 for Unity units, **but does not invert the Y axis**. MapleStory’s Y-axis orientation is opposite to Unity’s: what Maple calls negative Y (above ground), Unity interprets as negative Y (below origin). This likely affects spawning and platform positions universally. In our scenario, fixing the spawn height or inverting the Y conversion would prevent the player from starting underneath the platform in the first place. For example, had the player spawned at `(X=-4.4, Y=+0.8)` instead of -0.8, then `posY` would be +80px, and Platform 1 at 0px would satisfy `0 <= 80+50`, making it a collision candidate. The landing check would then snap the player to Y=0 in the first frame or two of the fall, setting `IsGrounded=true` as expected.

**Summary:** The collision detection logic itself (the LINQ query and landing condition) is geared toward finding a platform below a falling player and works as intended for normal cases (player above ground). However, due to a coordinate conversion mistake, the player was spawned *below* the ground platform. In that state, the collision query cannot find the platform above, so the character falls forever. The key fixes to investigate are ensuring the player’s starting Y is correct (likely by flipping the sign on Maple Y coordinates when converting to Unity) and possibly adjusting the platform search logic if characters could ever be below a platform legitimately. This will allow `GetPlatformBelow` to function and set `IsGrounded` appropriately, preventing infinite falling.
