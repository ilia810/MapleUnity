# Character Rendering Verification Summary

## Test Results: ✅ All Fixes Verified

### 1. Position Calculations Verified

The test confirmed that all body parts are positioned correctly using the C++ client formulas:

```
Body Position: (0, 0) ✓
Arm Position: (-10, -14) = bodyNavel - armHand ✓
Head Position: (-4, -7) = bodyNeck - headNeck ✓  
Face Position: (-3, -7) = headPosition + (headBrow - faceBrow) ✓
```

### 2. Key Formulas Confirmed

**Basic positioning formula:**
```
child_position = parent_position + parent_attachment - child_attachment
```

**Special cases verified:**
- Body is always at (0,0)
- Arm uses body's navel point and arm's hand point
- Face is positioned relative to head using brow points

### 3. Visual Test Objects Created

The test successfully created colored sprites for visualization:
- White square for body at (0,0)
- Red square for arm at (-10,-14)
- Green square for head at (-4,-7)
- Blue square for face at (-3,-7)

### 4. Z-Ordering System Working

Correct layer ordering verified:
- Body: 0 (base layer)
- Arm: -5 (behind body)
- Head: 10 (above body)
- Face: 11 (above head)

### 5. Equipment Positioning Verified

Hat test showed correct positioning:
```
Hat Position: (-7, -22) = headPosition + headVslot - hatVslot ✓
```

## Conclusion

All character rendering issues have been fixed. The Unity implementation now correctly:

1. **Anchors body at (0,0)** - No more offset issues
2. **Uses attachment points correctly** - Following C++ formulas exactly
3. **Positions face relative to head** - Using brow attachment points
4. **Maintains proper z-ordering** - Layers render in correct order
5. **Handles equipment properly** - Using the same attachment system

The character should now render exactly as in the original MapleStory client!
