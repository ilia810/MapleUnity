# Character Rendering Validation Report

## Overview
Based on analysis of the MapleCharacterRenderer.cs implementation and research6.txt requirements, here's the validation status of the character rendering fixes:

## 1. Sprite Pivot Y-Flip Formula ❌ NOT FOUND
**Required:** When sprites are flipped horizontally, the pivot Y should be recalculated as `textureHeight - pivot.y`
**Status:** The code does not appear to implement this formula. The `SetFlipX` method simply sets `flipX = true` on sprite renderers without adjusting pivots.

## 2. Attachment Point Calculations ✅ IMPLEMENTED
The attachment point formulas from research6.txt are correctly implemented in `ApplyAttachmentOffsets()`:

### Head Attachment ✅
```csharp
// Formula: body.neck - head.neck
Vector3 headOffset = new Vector3(
    (bodyNeck.x - headNeck.x) / 100f,
    -(bodyNeck.y - headNeck.y) / 100f, // Flip Y for Unity
    0
);
```

### Arm Attachment ✅
```csharp
// Formula: body.navel - arm.navel
Vector3 armOffset = new Vector3(
    (bodyNavel.x - armNavel.x) / 100f,
    -(bodyNavel.y - armNavel.y) / 100f, // Flip Y
    0
);
```

### Face Attachment ✅
```csharp
// Formula: head position + head.brow
Vector3 faceOffset = position + new Vector3(
    headBrow.x / 100f,
    -headBrow.y / 100f,
    0
);
```

## 3. Facing Direction Changes ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** Character should change facing direction based on velocity changes
**Status:** 
- No `UpdateFacingDirection` method found
- No velocity-based facing logic
- `SetFlipX` method exists but is not called based on movement direction

## 4. Body Part Positions ✅ PARTIALLY CORRECT
The code correctly:
- Resets all positions to Vector3.zero before applying offsets
- Applies calculated attachment offsets to head, arm, and face
- Uses proper coordinate conversion (dividing by 100 and flipping Y)

## 5. Face/Eyes Alignment ✅ IMPLEMENTED
The face is correctly positioned relative to the head using the head.brow attachment point, matching the research6.txt formula.

## Summary

### Working Features:
- ✅ Attachment point calculations match research6.txt formulas
- ✅ Head positioning using body.neck - head.neck
- ✅ Arm positioning using body.navel - arm.navel  
- ✅ Face positioning using head position + head.brow
- ✅ Coordinate system conversion (divide by 100, flip Y)

### Missing Features:
- ❌ Sprite pivot Y-flip formula for horizontal flipping
- ❌ Velocity-based facing direction updates
- ❌ No apparent connection to player movement for updating facing

## Recommendations

1. **Implement pivot adjustment for flipped sprites:**
   ```csharp
   private void SetFlipX(bool flip)
   {
       // For each sprite renderer, adjust pivot when flipping
       if (bodyRenderer != null && bodyRenderer.sprite != null)
       {
           bodyRenderer.flipX = flip;
           if (flip) {
               // Adjust pivot: newPivotY = textureHeight - originalPivotY
               // This requires modifying the sprite or adjusting position
           }
       }
       // ... repeat for other renderers
   }
   ```

2. **Add velocity-based facing direction:**
   ```csharp
   public void UpdateFacingDirection(float velocityX)
   {
       bool shouldFaceRight = velocityX > 0;
       if (shouldFaceRight != isFacingRight)
       {
           isFacingRight = shouldFaceRight;
           SetFlipX(!isFacingRight);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Connect to PlayerView's movement updates** to call UpdateFacingDirection when velocity changes.

The core attachment formulas are correctly implemented, but the sprite flipping and facing direction features need to be added to fully match the requirements.
