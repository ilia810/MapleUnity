# Character Rendering Fix Summary

## Overview
Based on research6.txt analysis, I've implemented critical fixes to the MapleUnity character rendering system to properly display character body parts.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Sprite Pivot Y-Calculation (CRITICAL FIX)
**File**: `Assets/Scripts/GameView/SpriteLoader.cs`
```csharp
// Fixed formula to properly convert from MapleStory's top-left to Unity's bottom-left coordinate system
float pivotY = 1.0f - (origin.y / texture.height);
```
This restores the Y-flip that was missing, ensuring sprites are vertically positioned correctly.

### 2. Attachment Point System Implementation
**File**: `Assets/Scripts/GameView/MapleCharacterRenderer.cs`
- Implemented full attachment point offset system
- Body parts now position relative to each other using attachment points:
  - Head → Body's neck attachment point
  - Arm → Body's navel attachment point  
  - Face/Hair → Head's brow attachment point

**File**: `Assets/Scripts/GameData/NX/NXAssetLoader.cs`
- Modified to extract all attachment points (neck, navel, hand, brow) from sprite data
- Returns dictionary of attachment points instead of single point

### 3. Applied Proper Positioning Formula
The implementation now follows MapleStory's two-part positioning system:
1. **Sprite origins** → Mapped to Unity pivots (anchor points)
2. **Attachment points** → Applied as transform position offsets

Example positioning logic:
```csharp
// Head position = body's neck attachment point
if (currentAttachmentPoints.TryGetValue("neck", out Vector2 neckPos))
{
    headPosition = new Vector3(neckPos.x / 100f, -neckPos.y / 100f, 0);
}
```

## Compilation Fixes
- Fixed namespace issues: `MapleClient` → `MapleUnity`
- Updated test scripts to use new attachment point API
- Fixed various compilation errors in test files

## Expected Results
With these fixes, character rendering should now display:
- Body at ground level (Y=0)
- Head positioned above body at neck attachment
- Arms at mid-body level (navel attachment)
- Face and eyes properly positioned within head

## Testing
Created `TestCharacterRenderingFix.cs` for verification, though Unity batch mode testing requires Unity installation access.

## Next Steps
The critical positioning issues have been addressed. The remaining tasks are:
- Verify fixes in Unity Editor with actual scene
- Add frame-specific animation delays (medium priority)
- Implement facial expression system (low priority)
