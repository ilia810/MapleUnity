# MapleUnity Map Generation Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to enable proper player movement and eliminate flickering in MapleUnity's generated maps.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Player Movement Issues
**Problem**: Player couldn't move when starting with a generated map.

**Root Causes**:
- No player spawning system integrated with map generation
- Missing connection between GameLogic platforms and Unity's FootholdManager
- GameManager was creating empty player GameObject without proper components

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created `PlayerSpawnManager` to handle intelligent spawn point detection
- Created `FootholdPhysicsConnector` to bridge GameLogic and Unity physics
- Updated `GameWorld` to use PlayerSpawnManager for proper spawning
- Updated `GameManager` to initialize FootholdPhysicsConnector with map data

### 2. Asset Flickering Issues
**Problem**: Visual flickering of map assets during gameplay.

**Root Causes**:
- Background tiles being constantly enabled/disabled every frame
- Mixed use of Z-position and sorting orders causing Z-fighting
- Inconsistent sorting layer usage ("Default" layer overused)
- No update threshold for background tiling

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created `BackgroundTilePool` for efficient tile pooling
- Added update threshold (0.5 units) to ViewportBackgroundLayer
- Ensured all sprites stay at Z=0, using only sorting order for depth
- Proper sorting layers already configured in TagManager
- Created `RenderingConfiguration` for centralized settings

## New Components

### 1. PlayerSpawnManager (`GameLogic/Core/PlayerSpawnManager.cs`)
- Finds appropriate spawn points (portals or platforms)
- Validates spawn positions
- Handles player initialization with proper height offset

### 2. FootholdPhysicsConnector (`GameView/FootholdPhysicsConnector.cs`)
- Bridges GameLogic Platform system with Unity's FootholdManager
- Converts footholds to platforms for physics queries
- Provides ground detection without Unity dependencies in GameLogic

### 3. BackgroundTilePool (`GameView/BackgroundTilePool.cs`)
- Efficient object pooling for background tiles
- Prevents constant GameObject creation/destruction
- Reduces flickering from enable/disable cycles

### 4. RenderingConfiguration (`GameView/RenderingConfiguration.cs`)
- Centralized rendering settings
- Camera configuration for MapleStory viewport (1024x768)
- Sorting layer constants and validation

### 5. Editor Tools
- `TestPlayerSpawn.cs` - Test player spawning in maps
- `RenderingDebugWindow.cs` - Monitor rendering issues and sorting layers

## How to Use

### Generate a Working Map Scene:
1. Use **MapleUnity > Generate Map Scene** to create a map
2. Use **MapleUnity > Test Player Spawn** to add player support
3. Click "Add Player to Current Scene" 
4. Enter Play mode - player should spawn and be able to move

### Debug Rendering Issues:
1. Use **MapleUnity > Rendering Debug** to monitor sorting layers
2. Check for renderers using "Default" layer
3. Verify no sprites have non-zero Z positions
4. Use "Apply MapleStory Camera Settings" to fix camera

### Movement Controls:
- Arrow Keys: Move left/right
- Space: Jump
- Down Arrow: Crouch (when implemented)
- Up/Down: Climb ladders (when near)

## Technical Details

### Sorting Layer Hierarchy:
1. Background (-1000 base)
2. Tiles (0 base)
3. Objects (0 base)
4. NPCs (500 base)
5. Effects (500 base)
6. Foreground (1000 base)
7. UI (highest)

### Camera Settings:
- Orthographic Size: 3.84 (for 768 pixel height)
- Background Color: Light blue (0.53, 0.81, 0.92)
- Near/Far Clip: -100/100

### Player Spawn Logic:
1. Check for specific portal ID
2. Look for spawn portal (type 0)
3. Find suitable platform near map center
4. Spawn 50 pixels above position to ensure proper landing

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Player spawns at valid location
- [ ] Arrow keys move player left/right
- [ ] Space key makes player jump
- [ ] Player lands on platforms properly
- [ ] No visual flickering during movement
- [ ] Backgrounds scroll with proper parallax
- [ ] All sprites render in correct order
- [ ] Camera follows player within bounds

## Known Limitations
- Player visual representation (MapleCharacterRenderer) needs character sprites
- Ladder climbing mechanics need testing
- Portal transitions need network implementation
- Monster/NPC interactions not yet implemented

## Next Steps
1. Create player prefab with all visual components
2. Implement character sprite loading
3. Add ladder/rope climbing
4. Implement portal transitions
5. Add monster AI and combat
