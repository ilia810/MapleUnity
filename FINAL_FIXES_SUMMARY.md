# Final Scene Generation Fixes Summary

## All Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. Sky Background Rendering Order - FIXED
**Problem**: Sky background (grassySoil) was rendering on top of other assets

**Solution**: 
- Configured proper sorting layers (Background, Tiles, Objects, NPCs, etc.)
- Set type 3 backgrounds to sorting order -500
- Added Z-position offset (10f) to push sky backgrounds back
- Sky now renders behind everything as expected

### 2. Henesys Tile Set - FIXED
**Problem**: brownBrick tileset was missing tiles (edD/1, enH0/3, enH1/3, edU/1)

**Solution**:
- Switched to `DeepgrassySoil` tileset which has ALL required tiles
- Added fallback system for any missing tiles
- Tiles now load correctly without errors

### 3. Sorting Layers Configuration - FIXED
**Problem**: Unity project didn't have proper sorting layers configured

**Solution**:
- Created sorting layers setup script
- Layers now configured in correct order:
  1. Default
  2. Background (sky, far backgrounds)
  3. Tiles (ground)
  4. Objects (buildings, decorations)
  5. NPCs (characters)
  6. Effects
  7. Foreground
  8. UI

## Current Status

When you run scene generation now, you should see:
- ✅ Blue sky background properly behind everything
- ✅ All tiles loading with DeepgrassySoil textures
- ✅ Objects (buildings) rendering above tiles
- ✅ NPCs rendering in front of buildings
- ✅ Proper depth sorting throughout the scene

## Remaining Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Transparent Textures**: Some textures show as transparent (PNG extraction issue)
   - Affects some decorative objects and NPCs
   - Scene still functional, just missing some visual elements

## Testing Instructions

1. Run **MapleUnity > Test Scene Generation**
2. Click **"Generate Henesys Scene"**
3. Verify:
   - Sky is blue and behind everything
   - Ground shows tiles (DeepgrassySoil texture)
   - Buildings render above ground
   - NPCs render in front of buildings

## Key Discoveries

1. **Tileset Selection**: Maps should have `info/tS` property, but Henesys doesn't, so we infer
2. **DeepgrassySoil**: Complete tileset with all variants Henesys needs
3. **Background Types**: Type 3 backgrounds tile in both directions (sky/color fill)
4. **Sorting Layers**: Essential for proper rendering order in Unity

## Files Modified

- `MapDataExtractor.cs` - Uses DeepgrassySoil for Henesys
- `BackgroundGenerator.cs` - Fixed sky background rendering
- `NXDataManagerSingleton.cs` - Added tile loading with fallbacks
- `SetupSortingLayers.cs` - Configures Unity sorting layers
