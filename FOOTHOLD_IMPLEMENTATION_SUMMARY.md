# FootholdManager Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented FootholdManager in the GameLogic layer to fix platform collision issues where the player was standing on air and falling through legitimate footholds.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. IFootholdService Interface (`Assets/Scripts/GameLogic/Interfaces/IFootholdService.cs`)
- Defines platform-agnostic foothold query operations
- Key methods: GetGroundBelow, IsOnGround, GetFootholdAt, LoadFootholds

### 2. FootholdService Implementation (`Assets/Scripts/GameLogic/Core/FootholdService.cs`)
- Concrete implementation matching SceneGeneration/FootholdManager logic
- Handles foothold queries, connectivity, and ground detection
- Returns ground Y - 1 to sink characters slightly into floor (matching NPC behavior)

### 3. MaplePhysicsConverter (`Assets/Scripts/GameLogic/Core/MaplePhysicsConverter.cs`)
- Handles coordinate conversions between Unity and MapleStory systems
- MapleY = -UnityY * 100, MapleX = UnityX * 100
- Ensures consistent coordinate system usage

### 4. Player Class Refactoring
- Refactored to use FootholdService instead of platform-based detection
- Now uses the same ground detection logic as NPCs
- Properly converts between Unity and MapleStory coordinates

### 5. FootholdDataAdapter (`Assets/Scripts/GameData/Adapters/FootholdDataAdapter.cs`)
- Converts between Platform and Foothold data structures
- Builds foothold connectivity for proper traversal

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Debug Namespace Conflict
- **Problem**: Namespace 'MapleClient.GameView' already contained a definition for 'Debug'
- **Solution**: Renamed Debug folder to Debugging to avoid conflict
- **Updated**: All references from MapleClient.GameView.Debug to MapleClient.GameView.Debugging

### 2. Vector2 Ambiguity
- **Problem**: Ambiguous references between UnityEngine.Vector2 and MapleClient.GameLogic.Vector2
- **Solution**: Added type aliases to disambiguate (UnityVector2 and MapleVector2)

### 3. Interface Implementation
- **Problem**: IInputProvider methods implemented as methods instead of properties
- **Solution**: Changed to properties as required by the interface

### 4. Coordinate Conversion
- **Problem**: Type mismatch when converting between Unity and GameLogic Vector2 types
- **Solution**: Created proper GameLogic.Vector2 instances before conversion

## Test Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive integration tests in FootholdCollisionIntegrationTests.cs
- Created debug tools: FootholdCollisionDebugTool.cs and TestFootholdIntegration.cs
- Tests verify proper ground detection, platform walking, jumping, and edge cases

## Result
The FootholdManager implementation is now complete and compiles successfully. The player should now:
- Stand properly on platforms without floating
- Use the same ground detection logic as NPCs
- Not fall through legitimate footholds
- Properly handle slopes and platform transitions
