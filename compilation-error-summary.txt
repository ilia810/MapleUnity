2. EDITOR SCRIPT ERRORS:

   A. CompilationStatusCheck.cs (1 error):
      - Line 26: 'CompilationPipeline' does not contain a definition for 'IsCompiling'

   B. RunRuntimeScaleTest.cs (5 errors):
      - Missing 'EditorSceneManagement' - needs using UnityEditor.SceneManagement

      - MapleCharacterRenderer missing properties: BodyId, HeadId, FaceId, HairId, EquipmentIds, IsLoaded

3. ROOT CAUSES:
   - Several test scripts are referencing old API methods/properties that no longer exist in the current implementation
   - Missing namespace imports (UnityEditor.SceneManagement)
   - Outdated test scripts that haven't been updated to match current class structures

4. QUICK FIXES NEEDED:
   - Remove or update TestRenderingLogic.cs
   - Remove or update VerifyScaleBasedFlipping.cs
   - Add missing using statements to RunRuntimeScaleTest.cs and RunScaleTest.cs
   - Fix CompilationStatusCheck.cs to use correct API
   - Clean up missing source file references
