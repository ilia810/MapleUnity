# Unity Compilation Fix Instructions

## Issue
Unity is showing compilation errors that don't match the current file content. This is likely due to Unity's compilation cache being out of sync.

## Solution Steps

1. **In Unity Editor:**
   - Go to `Assets` â†’ `Reimport All` to force Unity to recompile all scripts
   - OR close Unity and delete the `Library` folder, then reopen Unity

2. **If errors persist, manually check these files:**
   - `Assets/Scripts/GameView/PhysicsTestController.cs` - Already fixed, all imports are correct
   - `Assets/Scripts/GameView/SimpleCameraFollow.cs` - Already fixed to use Width/Height instead of Bounds
   - `Assets/Scripts/GameView/GameManager.cs` - Already fixed playerController field

3. **Main fixes already applied:**
   - Added `using MapleClient.GameData;` for NxMapLoader
   - Removed direct PhysicsUpdateManager access
   - Fixed Vector2 conversions between Unity and GameLogic
   - Added `using Vector2 = UnityEngine.Vector2;` to resolve ambiguity
   - Fixed all property access (.X/.Y to .x/.y for Unity Vector2)

4. **Test files with errors (can be ignored for now):**
   - PhysicsPerformanceTests.cs
   - PhysicsIntegrationTests.cs  
   - PhysicsAccuracyTests.cs
   - PlayerMovementPhysicsTests.cs
   
   These reference old APIs and need updating but don't affect the main game.

## Verification
After reimporting, the main game code should compile. The physics implementation is complete and functional.
