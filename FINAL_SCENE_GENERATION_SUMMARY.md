# Final Scene Generation Summary - All Issues Fixed

## âœ… All Issues Resolved

### 1. Tile Extraction and Loading - FIXED
**Problem**: 
- Tiles weren't being extracted because they lacked "tS" property
- Wrong tileset name ("wood" instead of "grassySoil")

**Solution**:
- Implemented `GetDefaultTileSet()` that correctly infers "grassySoil" for Henesys
- Created `GetTileSprite()` method for proper tile sprite loading
- Tiles now extract and load successfully (859 tiles, 90x60 pixel sprites)

### 2. Background Type 3 Handling - FIXED
**Problem**: Blue 256x256 squares weren't being tiled as sky backgrounds

**Solution**:
- Added `CreateFullScreenTiledBackground()` for type 3 backgrounds
- Sky now tiles properly across the entire screen

### 3. NPC Sorting Order - FIXED
**Problem**: NPCs appeared behind buildings

**Solution**:
- Updated sorting to use negative Y position
- NPCs now render correctly in front of buildings

### 4. PNG Extraction from NX Files - FIXED
**Problem**: Sprites were loading as black/transparent

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `ExtractPngFromBitmap()` with multiple extraction methods
- Sprites now extract correctly from NX bitmap nodes

## Testing Instructions

### Full Scene Generation Test:
1. **MapleUnity > Test Scene Generation**
2. Click **"Generate Henesys Scene"**
3. Verify in Scene view:
   - Blue sky background (tiled grassySoil)
   - Ground tiles visible (grassySoil tileset)
   - Buildings and objects with proper sprites
   - NPCs in front of buildings

### Tile Extraction Test:
1. **MapleUnity > Test > Tile Extraction Fix**
2. Click **"Test Henesys Tile Extraction"**
3. Should show:
   - 859 tiles extracted
   - Tileset: grassySoil
   - All sprites loading successfully

## Key Discoveries

1. **Tile Sets**: MapleStory v83 uses named tile sets like "grassySoil", not generic "wood"
2. **Tile Structure**: Tiles are organized as `Tile/{tileSet}.img/{variant}/{number}`
3. **Background Types**:
   - Type 0: Static image
   - Type 1: Horizontal tiling
   - Type 3: Full screen tiling (sky/color)
   - Type 4: Scrolling effects
4. **Henesys Specifics**: Uses grassySoil for both sky background and ground tiles

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Files:
- `MapDataExtractor.cs` - Tile extraction with default tileset
- `BackgroundGenerator.cs` - Type 3 background handling
- `TileGenerator.cs` - Tile sprite loading
- `NXDataManagerSingleton.cs` - Added GetTileSprite method
- `RealNxFile.cs` - Enhanced PNG extraction

### Debug/Test Files:
- `TestTileExtraction.cs`
- `DebugTileStructure.cs`
- `CheckGrassySoilTiles.cs`
- `VerifyGrassySoilVariants.cs`

## Performance Notes

- Tile sprites are 90x60 pixels (efficient size)
- PNG extraction uses multiple fallback methods
- Sprite caching prevents redundant loading

## Next Steps

The scene generation system is now fully functional. You can:
1. Generate other maps by changing the map ID
2. Add animation support for animated backgrounds
3. Implement parallax scrolling for backgrounds
4. Add foothold visualization for debugging
