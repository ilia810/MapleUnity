# Foothold Data Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated NX foothold data loading with the FootholdService to connect the GameData and GameLogic layers.

## Key Components Created

### 1. FootholdDataAdapter (GameData/Adapters/FootholdDataAdapter.cs)
- Converts between different foothold representations:
  - `Platform` objects (from NxMapLoader) → `Foothold` objects (for FootholdService)
  - `SceneGeneration.Foothold` → `GameLogic.Foothold`
  - `GameLogic.Foothold` → `Platform` (backward compatibility)
- Builds foothold connectivity information
- Assigns layer information based on vertical grouping

### 2. Updated NxMapLoader
- Now accepts an optional `IFootholdService` parameter
- Automatically updates the FootholdService when loading map data
- Converts platforms to footholds and builds connectivity

### 3. Updated GameManager
- Creates and manages a shared FootholdService instance
- Passes the FootholdService to both NxMapLoader and GameWorld
- Exposes FootholdService as a public property for debugging

### 4. Updated GameWorld
- Now accepts an external FootholdService instead of creating its own
- Prevents duplicate foothold loading (checks if footholds already loaded)
- Falls back to platform conversion for backward compatibility

### 5. Testing Tools
- **TestFootholdIntegration** (Editor window):
  - Tests map loading with foothold integration
  - Tests foothold queries (GetGroundBelow, IsOnGround, etc.)
  - Tests platform-to-foothold conversion
  - Tests scene foothold conversion

- **FootholdDebugVisualizer** (Runtime component):
  - Visual debugging of footholds in scene view
  - Shows foothold lines with different colors for properties
  - Displays foothold IDs and layer information
  - Shows connectivity between footholds

## Data Flow

1. **Map Loading**:
   ```
   NxMapLoader.GetMap() 
   → Loads platforms from NX data
   → FootholdDataAdapter.ConvertPlatformsToFootholds()
   → FootholdDataAdapter.BuildFootholdConnectivity()
   → FootholdService.LoadFootholds()
   ```

2. **Scene Generation**:
   ```
   MapDataExtractor.ExtractFootholds()
   → Creates SceneGeneration.Foothold objects
   → FootholdDataAdapter.ConvertSceneFootholdsToGameLogic()
   → Updates FootholdService (if GameManager exists)
   ```

## Key Features

- **Coordinate System**: Maintains MapleStory coordinate system (Y increases downward)
- **Connectivity**: Automatically builds Previous/Next connections between adjacent footholds
- **Layer Assignment**: Groups footholds by vertical position into layers
- **Environmental Properties**: Preserves slippery, conveyor, and wall properties
- **Thread Safety**: All operations are designed for Unity's main thread

## Usage Example

```csharp
// In GameManager initialization
var footholdService = new FootholdService();
var mapLoader = new NxMapLoader("", footholdService);
var gameWorld = new GameWorld(inputProvider, mapLoader, networkClient, assetProvider, footholdService);

// When map loads, footholds are automatically available
float groundY = footholdService.GetGroundBelow(playerX, playerY);
bool onGround = footholdService.IsOnGround(playerX, playerY);
```

## Testing

1. Open Unity Editor
2. Go to MapleUnity → Test → Foothold Integration
3. Click "Test Load Map with Footholds" to verify integration
4. Use FootholdDebugVisualizer in play mode to see footholds visually

## Next Steps

- Implement foothold-based physics for more accurate player movement
- Add support for special foothold types (moving platforms, etc.)
- Optimize foothold queries for large maps
- Add network synchronization for foothold states
