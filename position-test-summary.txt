=== Unity Character Sprite Position Test Results ===

The test successfully demonstrates how sprite positioning works with different pivot points:

1. BODY SPRITE (Bottom Pivot)
   - Size: 40x40 pixels
   - Pivot: (20, 0) - bottom center
   - Position offset: Y=0.00 (at ground)
   - Result: Bottom at Y=0.000, Top at Y=0.400

2. ARM SPRITE (Center Pivot)
   - Size: 30x30 pixels  
   - Pivot: (15, 15) - center
   - Position offset: Y=0.20 (mid-body)
   - Result: Bottom at Y=0.050, Top at Y=0.350

3. HEAD SPRITE (Bottom Pivot)
   - Size: 35x35 pixels
   - Pivot: (17.5, 0) - bottom center
   - Position offset: Y=0.28 (from attachment point)
   - Result: Bottom at Y=0.280, Top at Y=0.630

KEY FINDINGS:
- The pivot point significantly affects final positioning
- Body with bottom pivot correctly sits at ground level (Y=0)
- Arm with center pivot at Y=0.20 actually spans Y=0.05 to Y=0.35
- Head with bottom pivot at Y=0.28 starts exactly at that position

The positioning calculations are working correctly. The visual appearance issues are likely due to:
1. Incorrect pivot assignments in the sprite import
2. Missing or incorrect position offsets in the rendering code
3. The arm's center pivot causing it to appear lower than expected

RECOMMENDATION:
Check the actual sprite pivots in the NX loader and ensure they match MapleStory's expected values.
