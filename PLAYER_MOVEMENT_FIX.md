# Player Movement Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Player Not Grounded**: Player is constantly falling (Grounded: False, Velocity Y: -10)
2. **Platform Detection Failed**: Player spawning too high above platforms
3. **Camera Sinking**: Camera follows falling player
4. **Test Platforms Override**: SimplePlatformBridge creating test platforms even when real platforms exist

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Reduced Spawn Height Offset
- Changed from 0.5f (50 pixels) to 0.1f (10 pixels)
- This ensures player spawns closer to platforms

### 2. Fixed SimplePlatformBridge
- Added check to prevent overwriting existing platforms
- If MapData already has platforms, don't create test platforms

### 3. Created Debug Tools
- **DebugPlayerPhysics** window to monitor player state and platforms
- Shows player position, velocity, grounded state
- Lists platforms and checks which should be below player

## Remaining Issues to Fix

### 1. Platform Y Coordinate
The loaded platforms show Y=0 but the player needs proper collision detection. Check if:
- Platform Y coordinates are correct
- Player bottom position calculation is correct
- Platform detection range needs adjustment

### 2. Camera Setup
Need to ensure:
- Camera has PlayerCameraController attached
- Camera follows player properly
- Camera bounds are set correctly

## How to Test

1. Use **MapleUnity > Debug Player Physics** during play mode
2. Check player bottom Y position vs platform Y positions
3. Use "Force Ground Player" button to reset player position
4. Monitor if player stays grounded after landing

## Next Steps

1. Verify platform Y coordinates match visual representation
2. Add debug visualization for platforms in scene
3. Ensure gravity and collision detection work properly
4. Add proper camera controller to follow player
