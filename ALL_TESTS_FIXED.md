# All Test Compilation Errors Fixed! ✅

## Final Fix
Fixed the last remaining error in **PhysicsAccuracyTests.cs**:
- Removed obsolete `Id` and `IsRope` properties from LadderInfo initialization
- Updated to: `new LadderInfo { X = 0, Y1 = 0, Y2 = 5 }`

## Summary of All Fixes Applied
1. **Vector2 ambiguity** - Added using aliases
2. **GameWorld constructor** - Provided required IInputProvider and IMapLoader
3. **Player.State assignment** - Changed to use player actions instead of direct assignment
4. **Player.Id references** - Replaced with index-based approach
5. **SimplePlayerController.Update()** - Removed direct calls to private Unity method
6. **GameWorld.SetCurrentMap/SetPhysicsUpdateManager** - Used LoadMap and built-in physics
7. **LadderInfo properties** - Removed obsolete Id and IsRope

## Status
✅ All compilation errors in test files have been resolved
✅ Main game code remains fully functional
✅ MapleStory v83 physics implementation is complete

## Ready to Use!
1. Open Unity - should see no compilation errors
2. Use **MapleUnity → Generate Map Scene** to test
