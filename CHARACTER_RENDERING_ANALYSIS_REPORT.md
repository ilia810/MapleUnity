# Character Rendering Analysis Report

Based on the Unity debug logs, here's a detailed analysis of the character rendering issues:

## Current State of Character Rendering

### 1. Body Parts Loading
The system successfully loads character body parts from NX files:
- **Head**: 19x17 pixels, origin at (19, 17)
- **Body**: 22x31 pixels, origin at (17, 31)
- **Arm**: 10x19 pixels, origin at (5, 9)

### 2. Attachment Points Found
The system identifies multiple attachment points:
- **Body**:
  - `neck`: (-4, -32) - Where head attaches
  - `navel`: (-7, -20) - Where arm attaches
- **Arm**:
  - `navel`: (-13, 0) - Connection point to body
  - `hand`: (-1, 5) - For equipment
- **Head**:
  - `neck`: (0, 15) - Connection to body
  - `brow`: (-4, -5) - Where face/eyes attach

### 3. Positioning Analysis

#### Current Positioning Logic:
1. **Body** is positioned at Y=0 (ground level)
2. **Head** is positioned using neck attachment: Y = 0.32 (32 pixels up from body)
3. **Arm** is positioned using navel attachment: Y = 0.20 (20 pixels up from body)
4. **Face** is positioned at head brow: Y = 0.37

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Arm Positioning Issue**
   - The arm is positioned at Y=0.20, which appears to be at mid-body level
   - This should be correct for the navel attachment point
   - If the arm appears at leg level, it might be a sprite pivot issue

2. **Facing Direction Not Working**
   - The logs don't show any flip state changes
   - All sprites remain at flipX=false
   - The SetFlipX method might not be propagating to all child sprites

3. **Head/Face Misalignment**
   - Face is positioned relative to head's brow attachment point
   - The offset calculation seems correct (-4, -5) -> (-0.08, 0.37)
   - If misaligned, check if face sprite pivot is set correctly

## Root Causes

1. **Sprite Pivot Issues**
   - The pivot points from NX data might not be correctly applied to Unity sprites
   - Unity uses normalized pivots (0-1), but the calculation might be off

2. **FlipX Not Propagating**
   - The SetFlipX method might only affect the parent transform
   - Child sprites need their flipX property set individually

3. **Attachment Point Calculations**
   - The attachment offsets are being calculated but might have sign errors
   - The coordinate system conversion (MapleStory to Unity) might be incomplete

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Fix Sprite Pivots**
   ```csharp
   // Ensure pivot is calculated correctly
   float pivotX = origin.x / sprite.rect.width;
   float pivotY = origin.y / sprite.rect.height;
   ```

2. **Fix Facing Direction**
   ```csharp
   private void SetFlipX(bool flip)
   {
       // Apply to all child sprites
       foreach (var sr in GetComponentsInChildren<SpriteRenderer>())
       {
           sr.flipX = flip;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Debug Attachment Points**
   - Log the actual world positions after all transforms
   - Verify the coordinate system conversion is correct
   - Check if attachment points need to be flipped when sprite is flipped

## Next Steps

1. Create a test scene that loads a character and logs all positions
2. Implement flip propagation to all child sprites
3. Verify pivot calculations match expected values
4. Test with different animations to ensure consistency
