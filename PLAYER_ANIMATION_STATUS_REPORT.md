# Player Animation Status Report

## Executive Summary
The MapleUnity project currently has a **basic placeholder player system** without proper MapleStory character assets or animations. The player is rendered as a simple blue rectangle sprite, and while the animation event system is in place, no actual sprite animations are implemented.

## Current State

### 1. Player Rendering
- **SimplePlayerController.cs**: Creates a basic 30x60 pixel blue rectangle as the player sprite
- **No MapleStory character assets** are currently loaded or displayed
- Player color changes based on state (blue for normal, different shades for jumping/falling)
- No sprite-based animations, just color transitions

### 2. Animation System Architecture

#### GameLogic Layer (Events Only)
- **Player.cs** has a complete animation event system:
  - `PlayerAnimationEvent` enum defines all animation triggers
  - Events: Jump, Land, Attack, StartWalk, StopWalk, StartClimb, StopClimb, Crouch, StandUp
  - `AnimationEventTriggered` event notifies listeners
  - State machine properly triggers animation events

#### GameView Layer (Visual Representation)
- **SimplePlayerController.cs** implements `IPlayerViewListener`:
  - Receives animation events through `OnAnimationEvent()`
  - Has stub methods for each animation (PlayJumpAnimation, PlayLandAnimation, etc.)
  - Currently only creates simple particle effects, no sprite animations
  - Visual feedback is limited to color changes and basic particle effects

### 3. Missing Components

#### Asset Loading
- **No character sprite loading system** implemented
- NX file reader exists but not integrated for character assets
- No sprite sheet management for character animations
- No equipment/clothing layer system

#### Animation Implementation
- **MapleCharacterRenderer.cs** exists but is completely empty (just a MonoBehaviour stub)
- No frame-based animation system
- No sprite switching based on animation state
- No animation timing/frame rate control

### 4. Player States and Actions
The following states are defined but lack visual representation:
- Standing (idle)
- Walking
- Jumping/DoubleJumping/FlashJumping
- Falling
- Climbing (ladders/ropes)
- Crouching
- Swimming

## Technical Analysis

### Asset Pipeline Requirements
1. **Character.nx Integration**
   - Need to load character sprite data from Character.nx
   - Parse body parts (head, body, arm, etc.)
   - Handle animation frames for each action

2. **Equipment System**
   - Load equipment sprites from Character.nx
   - Layer equipment over base character
   - Handle equipment-specific animations

3. **Animation Data Structure**
   - Frame timing data
   - Origin/anchor points for each frame
   - Z-ordering for body parts

### Current Infrastructure
- **Positive**: 
  - Clean separation between logic and view layers
  - Event system properly propagates state changes
  - IPlayerViewListener interface allows easy extension
  
- **Negative**:
  - No actual sprite rendering for characters
  - No animation frame management
  - No equipment/layering system

## Recommended Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Character Sprites
1. Implement Character.nx data extraction
2. Load basic standing sprite for player
3. Replace blue rectangle with actual character sprite
4. Implement proper sprite origin/pivot handling

### Phase 2: Animation System
1. Create frame-based animation controller
2. Load animation data (frame sequences, timing)
3. Implement state-to-animation mapping
4. Add sprite switching based on current frame

### Phase 3: Full Character System
1. Implement body part layering (head, body, face, hair)
2. Add equipment rendering system
3. Support all animation states
4. Add facial expressions

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Skill animations and effects
2. Emotion/expression system
3. Cash shop items rendering
4. Name tags and chat bubbles

## Critical Path Items

### Immediate Needs
1. **Character.nx Parser**: Extract sprite and animation data
2. **Sprite Renderer**: Replace SimplePlayerController rendering
3. **Animation Controller**: Manage frame sequences and timing
4. **Asset Manager**: Load and cache character sprites

### Dependencies
- Requires understanding of Character.nx structure
- Need to implement proper coordinate system for character rendering
- Must handle MapleStory's specific rendering quirks (origins, z-ordering)

## Current Blockers
1. No Character.nx parsing implementation
2. MapleCharacterRenderer.cs is empty
3. No sprite sheet loading system
4. No animation timing system

## Summary
The player animation system has a solid **event-driven foundation** but lacks any actual **visual implementation**. The immediate priority should be loading and displaying basic character sprites from the NX files, followed by implementing a proper frame-based animation system. The current blue rectangle placeholder needs to be replaced with actual MapleStory character assets.
