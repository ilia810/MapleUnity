# SimplePlayerController Physics Conversion Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unity Physics Components
- **Removed Rigidbody2D**: The controller no longer uses Unity's physics engine
- **Converted Collider to Trigger**: BoxCollider2D is now set as `isTrigger = true` to prevent physics interactions
- **Removed all physics-based movement code**: No more velocity manipulation or collision detection

### 2. Converted to Pure Visual Controller
- The SimplePlayerController is now purely a visual representation
- It syncs position from the GameLogic Player class every frame
- Facing direction updates based on GameLogic velocity

### 3. Input Handling
- Input is handled by GameWorld using the existing IInputProvider interface
- SimplePlayerController no longer processes input directly
- All movement logic happens in GameLogic layer

### 4. Key Architecture Points

```
Unity Input (UnityInputProvider) 
    ↓
GameWorld.Update() 
    ↓
Player.UpdatePhysics() [MapleStory v83 physics]
    ↓
SimplePlayerController syncs visual position
```

### 5. Benefits
- **Authentic Physics**: All physics calculations now use MapleStory v83 formulas in GameLogic
- **Platform Independence**: Physics logic is completely separated from Unity
- **Testability**: Physics can be tested without Unity components
- **Network Ready**: GameLogic physics can be easily synchronized across network

### 6. Next Steps
1. Implement proper MapleStory v83 physics constants in MaplePhysics class
2. Add platform collision detection in GameLogic
3. Implement proper jump mechanics with double jump support
4. Add momentum and acceleration curves
5. Implement special movement states (swimming, flying, etc.)

## Modified Files
- `Assets/Scripts/GameView/SimplePlayerController.cs` - Converted to kinematic visual controller
- `Assets/Scripts/GameView/GameManager.cs` - Added GameWorld reference to controller
- `Assets/Scripts/Tests/GameView/SimplePlayerControllerTests.cs` - Created comprehensive tests

## Testing
Run the SimplePlayerControllerTests to verify:
- No Rigidbody2D component exists
- Collider is set as trigger
- Position syncs correctly from GameLogic
- Facing direction updates properly
- Physics calculations happen in GameLogic layer
