# Foothold-Based Spawning Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated PlayerSpawnManager.cs
- Added dependency on `IFootholdService` via constructor injection
- Replaced hardcoded spawn position (-4.4f, 0.8f) with actual foothold detection
- Implemented `FindPlatformSpawnPoint()` to use `FootholdService.GetGroundBelow()`
- Updated `GetSpawnPositionFromPortal()` to place players exactly on ground
- Added coordinate conversion using `MapleCoordinateConverter`

Key implementation details:
```csharp
// Find ground below portal position
float groundY = footholdService.GetGroundBelow(portal.X, portal.Y);

// Convert to Unity coordinates
return MapleCoordinateConverter.MapleToUnity(portal.X, groundY);
```

### 2. Updated GameWorld.cs
- Added `FootholdService` field and initialization
- Modified `OnMapLoaded()` to convert platforms to footholds
- Passes footholdService to PlayerSpawnManager constructor

### 3. Updated PlayerSpawnManagerTests.cs
- Modified tests to use `TestFootholdService` instead of Moq
- Added tests for:
  - Spawning at portal positions on ground
  - Using map center with foothold detection
  - Handling cases where no foothold is found
  - Specific portal ID spawning
  - Ensuring player is positioned exactly on ground

## Coordinate System
- MapleStory uses Y=0 at top, positive Y downward
- Unity uses Y=0 at bottom, positive Y upward
- Conversion handled by `MapleCoordinateConverter`

## Spawn Logic Flow
1. Check for specific portal ID if provided
2. Look for spawn portal (type 0)
3. Fall back to map center
4. Use `GetGroundBelow()` to find actual ground position
5. Convert coordinates from MapleStory to Unity system
6. Place player exactly on ground (no floating)

## Testing
Tests verify that:
- Players spawn on actual footholds, not floating
- Coordinate conversion works correctly
- Fallback logic handles missing footholds
- Portal-based spawning uses foothold detection
